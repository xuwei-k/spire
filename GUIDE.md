## Spire User's Guide

This guide explains the architecture, layout, and usage of Spire. Initially,
we will explore some of the basic structures and patterns used by Spire. Then,
we'll look at many of the concrete types that Spire defines. Finally, we'll
peek at some of the advanced or tricky corners of the library.

### Type Classes

Like many Scala libraries, Spire uses type classes to define generic
operations.

For example, `Ring[A]` is a type class that defines many basic operations,
such as `+` and `*` on a type `A`. When using type classes it's important to
try to distinguish the following:

 1. The type class itself (`Ring[A]`). This is often a trait.
 2. Concrete instances of the type class, such as `Ring[Int]`.
 3. Syntax implicits that use the type class to define operators.
 
The methods in these type classes are always given text names (like
`plus`). In some cases these names correspond to symbolic operators:
in the case of `plus`, it corresponds with `+`. When using these type
classes, users have the option of using the symbolic syntax on the
values directly or calling the method on the type class instance:

```scala
import spire.algebra.Ring
import spire.syntax.ring._

def usingSymbols[A: Ring](x: A, y: A): A = x + y
def usingNames[A](x: A, y: A)(implicit r: Ring[A]): A = r.plus(x, y)
```

Some methods (e.g. `sqrt`) do not have corresponding symbols. In those
cases, the method name itself can be used with the values:

```scala
def sqrt[A: NRoot](x: A): A = x.sqrt
```

#### Package Layout

In the case of `Ring[A]`, the type class itself is located in
`spire.algebra`. Except for a few special cases, all of Spire's type
classes can be found in `spire.algebra`.

Type class instances can be found in two different places. For types
defined in Spire, or code that is aware of Spire, type class instances
should be placed in the type's companion object. For example, `UByte`
(an unsigned byte type) has an instance of `Rig[UByte]` contained in
its companion object.

For types defined elsewhere that Spire supports directly (for example
the built-in number types) Spire defines objects in `spire.std` which
contain their instances. So to get all the instances for `Int` you'd
import them from `spire.std.int._`. To get all these "standard
instances" at one go, import `spire.std.any._`. This pattern should
also be used when supporting other number types that are not
Spire-aware.

Finally, syntax implicits are imported from objects in
`spire.syntax`. To get the syntax for `Ring[A]` you'd import
`spire.syntax.ring._`. Again, there is a shortcut package: you can
import `spire.syntax.all._` to get all syntax.

These imports might seem a bit confusing, but they are very useful
when you find a situation where Spire's types or operators conflict
with another library's.  We provide an even more basic import
(`spire.implicits._`) for when you want all instances and all
operators. This is nice when working in the console or experimenting,
and for when you're sure there won't be a conflict.

#### Usage

Most of the time, you'll be using type classes as context bounds. For
instance:

```scala
import spire.algebra._
import spire.std.any._
import spire.syntax.ring._

object Demo {
  def double[A: Ring](x: A): A = x + x
  def triple[A: Ring](x: A): A = x * 3
  println((double(3), triple(4)))
}
```

This code ends up being equivalent to:

```scala
object Demo {
  def double[A](x: A)(implicit ev: Ring[A]): A = ev.plus(x, x)
  def triple[A](x: A)(implicit ev: Ring[A]): A = ev.times(x, ev.fromInt(3))
  println((double(3)(IntAlgebra), triple(4)(IntAlgebra)))
}
```

The `IntAlgebra` type extends `Ring[Int]` and has been imported via
`spire.std.any._`. The implicits providing the binary operators `+`
and `*` (and also the implicit to convert the integer literal into an
`A`) were all imported form `spire.syntax.ring._`. And the `Ring`
context bound is really just sugar for an implicit parameter (the type
class instance).

Hopefully this small example gives you an idea of the basic mechanics
behind Spire's generic math capabilities.

#### Specialization

To achieve speed on-par with direct (non-generic) code, you will need
to use specialization. The good news is that most of Spire's code is
already specialized (and tested for proper performance). The bad news
is that you'll have to annotate all your generic code like so:

```scala
import spire.algebra._
import spire.std.any._
import spire.syntax.ring._

import scala.{specialized => sp}

object Demo {
  def double[@sp A: Ring](x: A): A = x + x
  def triple[@sp A: Ring](x: A): A = x * 3
  println((double(3), triple(4)))
}
```

There are too many gotchas with specialization to list here. But the
(very) short guide to specialization is:

 1. It's much easier to specialize methods.
 2. Calls from generic code into specialized code are not specialized.
 3. Limit specialization to types you'll use via `@sp(Int, Double)`.
 4. Specialization will increase bytecode size by a factor of x2-10.

If you have questions about specialization feel free to ask on the
mailing list. You may notice that some code in Spire is structured in
an unusual way, and often this is to make sure specialization works
properly.

You may find that it's easy to develop generic code without using
specialization first (to keep things simple) and then going back and
adding annotations later if necessary. This helps keep things simple
while you get your code working correctly, and it's a (relatively)
minor change to enable specialization later (as long as you are
consistent).

Of course, if your code is not generic, you can call into Spire's
specialized code without worrying about any of this (and the result
will be unboxed and fast).

### Type Classes

#### Properties

Spire's type classes are often described in terms of properties (or
"laws").  These properties must be true no matter what values are
used.

Here's a brief description of some of the most common properties:

 * *associativity*: `|+|` is associative if `(a |+| b) |+| c` = `a |+| (b |+| c)`.
 * *identity*: `id` is an identity value for `|+|` if `a |+| id` = `a` = `id |+| a`.
 * *inverse*: `|+|` has an `inverse` operation if `a |+| a.inverse` = `id` = `a.inverse |+| a`.
 * *commutativity*: `|+|` is commutative if `a |+| b` = `b |+| a`.

In some cases the operator names are different (e.g. `+`, `*`) but the
properties themselves remain the same.

### Eq

Spire provides an `Eq[A]` type class to represent type-safe
equality. This allows us to talk about types for which there isn't a
computationally useful notion of equality, and also to avoid
programming errors caused by universal equality.

`Eq[A]` provides two operators

 * `eqv` (`a === b`) equality operator.
 * `neqv` (`a =!= b`) inequality operator (defaults to `!(a === b)`).

Spire requires that `eqv` obey the laws of an equivalence relation, namely:

 * `a === a` (*reflexivity*)
 * if `a === b` then `b === a` (*symmetry*)
 * if `a === b` then `a` is `b` (*anti-symmetry*)
 * if `a === b` and `b === c` then `a === c` (*transitivity*)

The anti-symmetry property may seem confusing. The idea is that if `a === b`
then `a` and `b` must be substitutable for each other, such that for any
expression `f(x)`, `f(a) === f(b)`.

### Order

Total orderings in Spire are supported by the `Order[A]` type
class. Unlike other ordering type classes
(e.g. `scala.math.Ordering`), this one is specialized to avoid boxing.
`Order[A]` extends `Eq[A]` can be implemented via a single `compare`
method, although it provides all of the following:

 * `eqv` (`a === b`)
 * `neqv` (`a =!= b`)
 * `lt` (`a < b`)
 * `gt` (`a > b`)
 * `lteqv` (`a <= b`)
 * `gteqv` (`a >= b`)
 * `compare` (`a compare b`)
 * `min` (`a min b`)
 * `max` (`a max b`)

Instances of `Order[A]` are required to observe the following
properties:

 * if `a <= b` and `b <= a` then `a === b` (*anti-symmetry*)
 * if `a <= b` and `b <= c` then `a <= c` (*transitivity*)
 * either `a <= b` or `b <= a` (*totality*)

Additionally, total orderings across fields should obey the following
additional laws:

 * if `a <= b` then `(a + c) <= (b + c)` (*O1*)
 * if `zero <= a` and `zero <= b` then `zero <= (a * b)` (*O2*)
 
(These are laws are required by ordered fields.)

In some cases users may need to use (or define) total orderings that
do not follow all these laws, or may break laws required by other
structures. An example would be the lexicographic ordering of complex
numbers, which breaks *O2*.  In these cases, users will need to be
aware of the risks and limit their use to situations where the
particular law is not needed.

### PartialOrder

Partial orderings in Spire are supported by the `PartialOrder[A]` type class.
Its implementation differs from `scala.math.PartialOrdering` in two features: `PartialOrder`
is specialized to avoid boxing, and the `partialCompare` method returns a `Double` and
avoids allocation of an `Option[Int]` instance. `PartialOrder[A]` extends `Eq[A]`, and can
be implemented via a single `partialCompare` method, described below. `PartialOrder` provides:

 * `eqv` (`a === b`)
 * `neqv` (`a =!= b`)
 * `lt` (`a < b`)
 * `gt` (`a > b`)
 * `lteqv` (`a <= b`)
 * `gteqv` (`a >= b`)
 * `partialCompare` (`a partialCompare b`)
 * `tryCompare` (`a tryCompare b`)
 * `pmin` (`a pmin b`) -- returns the least element if they can be compared
 * `pmax` (`a pmax b`) -- returns the greatest element if they can be compared

A partial order is defined from a binary relation `<=`, which satisfies the relations:

* `a <= a` (*reflexitivity*)
* if `a <= b` and `b <= a`, then `a === c` (*anti-symmetry*)
* if `a <= b` and `b <= c`, then `a <= c` (*transitivity*)

To compute both `<=` and `>=` at the same time, the method `partialCompare` uses
a `Double` number to encode the result of both comparisons. The truth table is defined as follows:

| `a <= b` |`a >= b` |    `partialCompare(a, b)` |   corresponds to |
|:----:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| `true` |  `true`  |  `0`  |   `a === b`  |
| `false` | `false` | `NaN` | `a` incomparable with `b` |
| `true` | `false` | `-1` | `a < b` |
| `false` | `true` | `1` | `a > b` |

The method `tryCompare` returns maps `-1.0`, `0.0`, `1.0` to `Some(-1)`, `Some(0)`, `Some(1)`,
and `NaN` to `None`, allowing the use of `getOrElse` and higher-order methods, at the price of an
`Option[Int]` allocation.

Instances of `PartialOrder[A]` are required to observe the properties above.

Note that `Order[A]` extends `PartialOrder[A]`, but for pedagogical purposes, `Order[A]` is presented first
in this guide.

#### Groups

The most basic algebraic type classes Spire supports involve a single
associative binary operator (called `combine` and represented as `|+|`):

 * `Semigroup[A]` just the associative operator `|+|`, nothing more.
 * `Monoid[A]` a semigroup that also has an identity element `id`.
 * `Group[A]` a monoid that also has an inverse operation (`inverse` or `|-|`).
 * `CSemigroup[A]` a semigroup that is commutative.
 * `CMonoid[A]` a monoid that is commutative.
 * `AbGroup[A]` an "abelian group", a group that is commutative.

Most types have many possible implementations of these types
classes. In these cases Spire requires users to explicitly choose
which implementation they want.

Spire also defines two parallel group hierarchies for *additive* and
*multiplicative* groups. These have the same properties but different
names and symbols. The following list provides the generic, additive,
and multiplicative variants:

 * operator method: `combine`, `plus`, `times`
 * operator symbol: `|+|`, `+`, `*`
 * identity name: `id`, `zero`, `one`
 * inverse method: `inverse`, `negate`, `reciprocal`
 * inverse symbol: `inverse`, `-` (unary), `reciprocal`
 * inverse binary operator: `|-|`, `-` (binary), `/`

#### Rings and Fields

Rings are a set together with two binary operation (additive and
multiplicative). Spire defines these by extending the appropriate
additive and multiplicative group traits. The following list roughly
describes the Ring-like type classes Spire provides:

 * `Semiring[A]` provides `+`, `zero`, and `*`.
 * `Rig[A]` provides `+`, `zero`, `*`, and `one`.
 * `Rng[A]` provides commutative `+`, `zero`, `-`, and `*`.
 * `Ring[A]` provides commutative `+`, `zero`, `-`, `*`, and `one`.
 * `CRing[A]` provides commutative `+`, `zero`, `-`, commutative `*`, and `one`.

The following list makes clear how these type classes are defined via
inheritance:

 * `Semiring[A]` extends `AdditiveMonoid[A]` with `MultiplicativeSemigroup[A]`
 * `Rig[A]` extends `Semiring[A]` with `MultiplicativeMonoid[A]`
 * `Rng[A]` extends `Semiring[A]` with `AdditiveAbGroup[A]`
 * `Ring[A]` extends `Rig[A]` with `Rng[A]`
 * `CRing[A]` extends `Ring[A]` with `MultiplicativeCMonoid[A]`

Rings also provide a `pow` method (`**`) for doing repeated multiplication.

#### EuclideanRings

Spire supports euclidean domains (called `EuclideanRing[A]`). A
euclidean domain is a commutative ring (`CRing[A]`) that also supports
euclidean division (e.g. floor division or integer division). This
structure generalizes many useful properties of the integers (for
instance, quotients and remainders, and greatest common divisors).

Formally, euclidean domains have a *euclidean function* f such that
for any `x` and `y` in `A`, if `y` is nonzero, then there are `q` and
`r` (quotient and remainder) such that `a = b*q + r` and `r = 0` or
`f(r) < f(b)`. For integers, `f` is usually the absolute value
function.

Spire's `EuclideanRing[A]` supports the following operations:

 * `quot` (`a /~ b`) finding the quotient (often integer division).
 * `mod` (`a % b`) the remainder from the quotient operation.
 * `quotmod` (`a /% b`) combines `quot` and `mod` into one operation.
 * `gcd` (`a gcd b`) find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
 * `lcm` (`a lcm b`) find the lowest common multiple of `a` and `b`.

Spire requires that `b * (a /~ b) + (a % b)` is equivalent to `a`.

#### Fields

Fields are commutative rings with commutative multiplication and
multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. Fields generalize
how most people think about rational numbers.

Spire's `Field[A]` supports the following operations:

 * `div` (`a / b`) divide `a` by `b`.
 * `reciprocal` (`a.reciprocal`) the multiplicative inverse of `a`, i.e. `one/a`.

Even though fields sit at the top of the ring hierarchy, there are
many operations which are not provided by fields:

 * equality and ordering (provided by `Eq[A]` and `Order[A]`).
 * square root, and other roots (provided by `NRoot[A]`).
 * sine, cosine, and trigonometric functions (provided by `Trig[A]`).

#### Irrational and Transcendental type classes

Spire supports square roots and fractional powers via
`NRoot[A]`. There are three basic methods available:

 * `sqrt` (`a.sqrt`) finds the square root of `a`
 * `nroot` (`(a nroot k)`) finds the kth root of `a`
 * `fpow` (`(a fpow b)`) takes `a` to the fractional power `b`

Spire does not have any fractional types that can represent irrational
roots exactly. This means that many laws we might like to write about
roots will be weaker than we would like:

 * `a.sqrt` = `(a nroot 2)` = `(a fpow 2.reciprocal)`
 * if `A` can represent `1/k` exactly, then `(a nroot k)` = `(a fpow k.reciprocal)`
 * if `(a nroot k)` is rational, then `(a nroot k).pow(k)` = `a`
 
Approximate types like `Double` and `BigDecimal` have a built-in
precision to which Spire can find roots. Exact types like `Rational`
do not have `NRoot` instances defined by default, but instances can be
instantiated with user-provided precision.

Similarly, Spire supports the Trigonometric functions via
`Trig[A]`. The preceeding caveats about precision apply to these
functions and values as well. The following methods are supported:

  * `e` Euler's number
  * `pi` Ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference.

  * `exp(a)` Raise `e` to `a`-th power.
  * `expm1(a)` Equivalent to `exp(a) - 1` with less error.
  * `log(a)` Find the natural logarithm of `a` (`r` such that `expr(r)` = `a`)
  * `log1p(a)` Equivalent to `log(1 + a)` but with less error.

  * `sin(a)` Sine: the y-coordinate of the unit circle.
  * `cos(a)` Cosine: the x-coordinate of the unit circle.
  * `tan(a)` Tangent: equivalent to `sin(a) / cos(a)`.

  * `asin(a)` inverse sine function, `asin(sin(a))` = `a`.
  * `acos(a)` inverse cosine function, `acos(cos(a))` = `a`.
  * `atan(a)` inverse tangent function, `atan(tan(a))` = `a`.
  * `atan2(y, x)` like `atan` but returns results in `(-pi, pi]`.

  * `sinh(x)` hyperbolic sine, y-coordinate of the unit hyperbola.
  * `cosh(x)` hyperbolic cosine, x-coordinate of the unit hyperbola.
  * `tanh(x)` hyperbolic tangent, `sinh(a) / cosh(a)`.

  * `toRadians(a)` convert degrees (e.g. `180`) to pi-radians (e.g. `pi`)
  * `toDegrees(a)` convert pi-radians (e.g. `pi/2`) to degrees (e.g. `90`).

Spire is able to calculate trigonometric values (like pi) and
functions (like sine) to arbitrary precision when using
`BigDecimal`. Unlike with `NRoot`, there is no support for creating
`Trig[Rational]` instances with arbitrary precision (although an
instance with `Double` precision can be found in
`spire.optional.rationalTrig`).

#### Modules, VectorSpaces, &co

TODO

### Types

This section attempts to chronicle the existing number types in terms of their
capabilities and problems.

#### Byte, Short, Int, and Long

These built-in integral types are all signed and have a fixed-width (8, 16,
32, and 64 bits respectively). Division with these types is truncated, and
overflow can silently occur when numbers to get too big (or too small).
Division by zero will trigger an exception.

It's worth noting that the JVM does not support operating on `Byte` and
`Short` directly: these operations will usually return `Int`. This can cause
confusion when using type inference, and can also lead to differences between
direct code (where adding bytes produces an int) and generic code (where
adding bytes produces a byte).

#### Float and Double

These fractional types correspond to IEEE-754 floating point (32- and 64-bit
respectively). They contain three sentinel values: positive and negative
infinity and NaN. Large positive and negative quantities will overflow to
their respective infinity value, and division by zero will silently go to
infinity.

Comparison and equality semantics for NaN are tricky (for example NaN == NaN
is false). This also means that there is no total ordering for doubles that
complies with IEEE comparisons. For an alternate `Ordering[Double]` that is
total, see `spire.optional.totalfloat`.

Since floating-point values are approximations of real values, loss of
precision can occur when adding values of different magnitudes. Thus, many
operations are not always associative. Spire assumes that users who work with
`Float` and `Double` are aware of these problems, and provides instances like
`Ring[Double]` even though it will fail to be associative in some cases.

#### BigInt

This integral type is unbounded--it will never overflow (although operations
will get slower and slower as the value gets larger). This is probably one of
the least difficult types to use correctly.

#### BigDecimal

This fractional type is different than the previous floating point values. It
contains a `MathContext` object which specifies a certain number of decimal
digits of precision (34 by default). Results will be rounded to this level of
precision, which also makes this type not associative in some cases (although
with user-specified precision it is easier to avoid cases where this matters).

The math context also defines how values should be rounded. Since this type is
decimal, it can exactly represent any decimal number (unlike a floating point
value) although its math context will need enough digits to do so.

As with floating point, Spire makes a best effort to support this type even
though there may be problems related to precision and rounding. Spire also
provides capabilities which the underlying type lacks, including roots,
fractional powers, and trigonometric methods.

#### Rational

This fractional type represents a rational number, a fraction of two integers
(`n/d`). It is an exact type, although as you might expect it can't represent
irrational numbers without approximating them as rationals. It is unbounded,
although as the fraction becomes larger or more complex, operations will
become slower. Rationals are always stored in simplest form to speed up future
calculations.

This is probably the easiest fractional type to use correctly.

#### SafeLong

This integral type is also unbounded, like `BigInt`. However, it is
more efficient for small values, where it will use a `Long`
instead. There is usually no reason to prefer using a `BigInt` over a
`SafeLong` except to comply with an external API, or in cases where
most values are expected to exceed a long's storage capacity.

#### Natural

This is a simple unbounded, unsigned integral type. It models natural
numbers a as a cons list of digits (each "digit" being a 32-bit
unsigned integer). For relatively small values (32-128 bits) it is
often faster than `SafeLong` or `BigInt`. For larger values it becomes
slower.

The `Natural` type a bit of an odd-ball type at present. However the
fact that it is guaranteed to be non-negative is useful.

#### UByte, UShort, UInt, and ULong

These unsigned integral types are provided by Spire. They have most of
the same operations as their signed counterparts, although they use
unsigned division which is a bit more involved.

They are value classes, so in most cases there should be no extra
overhead when compared with their primitive counterparts. The one
exception is with arrays. `Array[UInt]` will be boxed whereas
`Array[Int]` is not. Since conversions between `UInt` and `Int` only
exit at compile-time, it's easy to work around this issue by storing
`UInt` instances in an `Array[Int]`.

Writing literal unsigned values is slightly more cumbersome than their
signed counterparts (consider `UInt(7)` versus `7`). Spire provides
syntax imports which make these slightly easier to write:

```scala
import spire.syntax.literals._

ui"7" // equivalent to UInt(7)
```

#### FixedPoint

This value class uses a `Long` with an implicit denominator. The type
itself doesn't contain information about the denominator. Instead, an
implicit `FixedScale` instance is required to provide that context
when necessary (for instance, during multiplication). Like the
previous unsigned values, fixed point values will not be boxed in most
cases.

This type is designed to solve a specific type of problem and should
only be used in situations where a large number of rational numbers
with the same denominator are needed, and efficiency is very
important.

#### Complex[A] and Quanternion[A]

These generic types represent complex numbers (`x + yi`) and
quaternions (`w + xi + xj + zk`) respectively. They can be
parameterized with any fractional type `A` which has a `Field[A]`,
`NRoot[A]`, and `Trig[A]`. In general these values are as exact as
their underlying `A` values are, although in some cases approximate
results are necessarily returned (in cases where roots or trigonometry
functions are used).

These types are specialized, so most operations should be quite fast
and not cause unnecessary boxing. However, these types use more memory
than a non-generic complex number based on `Double` values would, and
are a bit slower.

#### Number

This is a boxed number type that approximates the semantics of numbers
in a dynamically-typed numeric tower (like Scheme or Python). There
are four subtypes of `Number`, based on `SafeLong`, `Double`,
`BigDecimal`, and `Rational`. Combining two numbers will always return
a number of the highest precision.

`Number` is a good choice for users who want simple and correct
numbers. The type keeps operations as safe as possible, while
providing access to all operators and methods.

#### Interval[A]

Interval supports arithmetic across a range of possible `A`
values. This can be thought of as representing uncertainty about a
single, actual value, or as operating on the entire set of values
simultaneously. Any type that has an `Order[A]` can be used in an
interval, although most arithmetic operations will require additional
type classes (ranging from `AdditiveSemigroup[A]` for `+` to
`Field[A]` for `/`).

Intervals may be unbounded on either side, and bounds can be open or
closed.  (An interval includes closed boundaries, but not open
boundaries). Here are some string representations of various
intervals:

 * `[3, 6]` the set of values between 3 and 6 (including both).
 * `(2, 4)` the set of values between 2 and 4 (excluding both).
 * `(1, 2]` half-open set, including 1 but not 2.
 * `(-∞, 5)` the set of values less than 5.

Intervals model continuous spaces, even if the type A is discrete. So
for instance when `(3, 4)` is an `Interval[Int]` it is not considered
"empty" , even though there are no `Int` values between 3 and 4. This
is because we can multiply the interval by 2 to get `(6, 8)` which is
clearly not empty. The underlying continuous interval contains values
which when multiplied by a scalar become valid `Int` values.

#### Polynomial[C]

Currently Spire supports univariate polynomials. These are polynomials
with a single variable (e.g. *x*) with the following structure:

```
c0 + (c1 * x^1) + (c2 * x^2) + ... + (cn * x^n)
```

The coefficients (`c0` through `cn`) are values of the type `C`, and
the exponents (`1` through `n`) are `Int` values (this does mean that
Spire's implementation only supports polynomials whose exponents are
less than 2147483648).

Like interval, arithmetic on polynomials is accomplished using type
classes for `C`, such as `Semiring[C]`. With the right type classes,
polynomials can support all the arithmetic operations covered by
euclidean rings, but not fields. Division and reciprocal operations
are impossible because polynomials do not support fractional or
negative exponents. Polynomials also support `interval`, `derivative`,
and other operations.

Spire does support a convenient syntax for literal polynomials. By
importing `spire.syntax.literals._` (or just `spire.implicits._`) you
can use the `poly` string interpolator to create
`Polynomial[Rational]` instances:

```scala
import spire.syntax.literals._
poly"3x^2 - 5x + 1"
poly"5/4x^6 - 7x - 2"
poly"1.2x^3 - 6.1x^2 + 9x - 3.33"
```

Spire actually supports two types of polynomials: dense and
sparse. For most simple polynomials used in these examples, you'll
probably want dense polynomials. However, in cases where your
polynomials have a few terms with very large exponents the sparse
implementation will be more efficient. In any case, the underlying
representation is an implementation detail and both types support the
same operations (and can interoperate).

#### Algebraic

The `Algebraic` type is an implementation of a number for "Exact
Geometric Computation". It represents algebraic numbers using an AST
of the operations performed on it. `Algebraic` numbers can be compared
accurately and exactly. This means that if we have two numbers `a` and
`b`, then `a compare b` is always correct, regardless of whether they
are irrational or incredibly close to each other. They are suitable
for use in algorithms that use square- or n-roots and rely on sign
tests and numeric comparison to work correctly.

On top of exact comparisons/sign tests, `Algebraic` is able to
approximate itself to any desired precision, after the fact. This
works for both absolute approximations, such as `x +/- 0.00001`, or
relative approximations, such as `x.toBigDecimal(new MathContext(10000))`.

Because `Algebraic` can represent algebraic numbers (note: we are adding
support for polynomial roots, not just n-roots), they have a wider range
than `Rational`. However, whereas `Rational` represents numbers exactly,
`Algebraic` can only compare exactly. They also sacrifice performance to
achieve this, and so are not suitable for use where you need performance
and can tolerate a certain amount of error.

#### Real

`Real` stands for "computable real". Spire's `Real` implementation is
based on ERA, written in Haskell by David Lester. Computable real
numbers are those which can be computed (i.e. approximated) to any
desired precision. Unlike `Double` and `BigDecimal`, `Real` values are
not stored as approximations, but rather as a function from a desired
precision to the closest approximate value.

If we have an instance `x` of `Real` which approximates a real number
*r*, this means that for any precision *p* (in bits), our instance
will produce an *x* such that *x/2^p* is the closest rational value to
*r*. Translated into Scala, this means that `x.apply(p)` returns a
`SafeLong` value `x`, such that `Rational(x, SafeLong(2).pow(p))` is a
best approximation for *r*.

Spire represents two types of `Real` values: `Exact` and
`Inexact`. The former are rational values for which we have an
existing instance of `Rational`, and are inexpensive to work with. The
latter are functions for approximating (potentially) irrational
values, are lazily evaluated and memoized, and can potentially be very
expensive to compute.

As with `Rational` values, operations on `Real` values are able to
obey the relevant algebraic identities. But unlike `Rational`, `Real`
supports roots and trigonometric functions. Furthermore, important
trig identities are also preserved:

```scala
import Real.{sin, cos}
def circle(a: Real): Real = (cos(a).pow(2) + sin(a).pow(2)).sqrt
// will return Real(1) no matter what value is provided
```

One interesting consequence of the design of computable real numbers
is non-continuous operations (such as sign tests, comparisons, and
equality) cannot be performed exactly. If `x.apply(p)` returns `0`,
there is no way to know whether the value is actually zero, or just a
very small value (either positive or negative!) which is approximately
zero at this precision. Similarly, it's not possible to say that `x`
is equal to `y`, but only that they are equivalent (or not) at a given
precision.

Spire currently bakes in a "default" precision to use with these kinds
of methods. Furthermore, these methods will always work with `Exact`
values: the issues only arise when using `Inexact` values. Given that
the alternative to using `Real` is to use another approximate type,
providing approximate comparisons and equality seems like a reasonable
compromise.

### Which number types should I use?

Spire provides many number types, and it is not always obvious what their
relative merits are. This section explains the distinctions between them, and
may help you decide which numeric representation(s) to use.

There is usually a tension between numbers that have correctness caveats (like
possible overflow or precision issues) and numbers that have performance
caveats (like extra allocations and/or slower code). Spire provides a wide
range of numeric types that should address most needs.

#### Natural numbers (unsigned, whole-value numbers)

For non-negative numbers, the safe type to use is `Natural`. It is quite fast
when representing small-ish numbers (128-bits or less), but has no upper bound
on the values it can represent. However, its unique cons-structure means that
for very large values `BigInt` and `SafeLong` may be faster. Since it only
supports non-negative values, subtraction is non-total (and may throw an
exception).

If your values are guaranteed to be small (or you are prepared to detect
truncation), you can use `UByte` (8-bit), `UShort` (16-bit), `UInt` (32-bit),
or `ULong` (64-bit), depending on how much space you need. These types have
the same unsigned semantics as unsigned types in languages like C. These types
are not boxed, although care must be used with arrays (like any value class).

#### Integer numbers (signed, whole-value numbers)

There are two safe types that can be used with integer values: `SafeLong` and
`BigInt`. Both support arbitrarily large values, as well as the usual
semantics for things like integer division (`quot`). The former (`SafeLong`)
performs much better for values that can be represented with a `Long` (e.g.
64-bit or less), and is a good default choice. When dealing with values that
are mostly or entirely very large, `BigInt` may be a bit faster.

Like the unsigned case, you can use `Byte` (8-bit), `Short` (16-bit), `Int`
(32-bit), or `Long` (64-bit) to handle cases where your values are small, or
where you want to avoid allocations and will handle truncation issues
yourself. These types are provided by Scala (and ultimately the JVM) and will
not cause object allocations.

#### Fractional numbers (numbers that can be divided)

There are many different fractional flavors, which support various trade-offs
between expressive power, precision, and performance.

Fractional types come in two basic flavors: precise or imprecise. Imprecise
types (like `Double`) will accumulate error and are not associative in some
cases (meaning that `(x + y) + z` may produce different results than `x + (y +
z)`). These types are often faster than precise types but can be risky to use.

Precise numbers make stronger precision guarantees, but at the cost of
performance or expressiveness. They are often a bit slower, and may restrict
the operations they support (to preserve guarantees about precision).

##### Precise types

The most powerful precise type is `Real`. It represents computable real
numbers, and supports all the operations you would expect, including roots and
trigonometry. However, irrational values (like `Real(2).sqrt` or `Real.pi`)
are represented via functions from precision to approximations. This means
that in some situations this type might be too slow, or use too much memory.
Additionally, operations requiring comparison or equality tests can only be
approximately computed. However, this type should never accumulate error, so
your results will always be correctly approximated to whatever precision you
need.

The next precise type is `Algebraic`. This type supports all rational values
as well as roots. However, it cannot represent transcendental values like "pi",
making its values a subset of `Real`'s. Unlike `Real`, this type is able to do
exact sign tests (and thus, equality tests and comparisons). Due to the ASTs
`Algebraic` uses to represent expressions, execution may be slow and involve
lots of allocations.

Finally there is `Rational`. This type represents values as irreducible
fractions (e.g. `n/d`). `Rational` cannot represent irrational values (such as
roots), but efficiently implements all operations on rational values. This
type has the fewest performance "gotchas", although obviously fractions with
large numerators or denominators will take longer to operate on.

##### Imprecise types

These types are more efficient than the precise types, but require care and
analysis to ensure that results are correct and sufficiently accurate.

The imprecise type with the most potential precision is `BigDecimal` which is
provided by Scala. This number approximates real values to a number of decimal
(base-10) digits (by default 34). Unlike floating point values, this type has
an exact representation of values like `0.111110`, and the user can use
`java.math.MathContext` to configure how much precision is used. Even so, the
type is still subject to accumulated rounding error, and thus is not truly
associative.

Next come `Float` and `Double`, the built-in 32- and 64-bit floating-point
implementations on the JVM. The pitfalls of using floating-point values are
well-known (and documented elsewhere) but these types are very fast.

Finally, Spire supports the experimental `FixedPoint` class. This value class
uses unboxed `Long` values to represent fractions in terms of user-specified
denominator (supplied via an implicit `FixedScale` instance). This is a very
special-purpose type to be used in cases where floating-point approximations
have problems and unboxed values are required. You should avoid this type
unless your applications has a known, specific need for fixed-point
arithmetic.

#### Other types

The other numeric and pseudo-numeric types (like `Polynomial`, `Interval`,
`Complex`, and `Quaternion`) each implement specific functionality, so there
should be less confusion about which type to use. The sections describing
these types explain their properties and trade-offs.

### Pseudo-Random Number Generators, Distributions, etc

Since Spire tries to make number types more pluggable in Scala code, it only
makes sense that we'd want to allow users to easily generate a wide variety of
number types using pluggable PRNGs. The `spire.random` package contains random
number generators appropriate to many different tasks, as well as a functional
interface to creating uniform distributions of values.

#### Pseudo-Random Number Generators

**This section needs revising! Immutable generators have been replaced
by the `Random[A]` monad, and the package structure has changed a bit!**

Spire supports two types of PRNGs: mutable and immutable.

The `mutable.Generator` trait represents a PRNG strategy. Using
uniformly-generated `Int` or `Long` values it can generate random values,
arrays of values, and so on. Defining a generator is relatively easy (for a
very simple example see `Lcg64`).

By default, generators are not threadsafe. A synchronized generator can be
created from an unsynchronized one via the `sync` method. Generators can be
copied, and their seeds can be saved and restored. This allows users to create
deterministic streams of values by using the same seed. In general, it is
preferred for users to create and use their own generators as opposed to
relying on a single generator across threads.

Although the `mutable.Generator` trait itself only provides low-level methods
like `nextInt`, it can produce values of any type using the `Dist[A]` type
class, which will be discussed in the next section.

The `immutable.Generator` trait is similar to `mutable.Generator`, although
the state it stores is immutable. Each time a number is generated a new
generator is returned as well, which allows these generators to be used in a
pure-functional context. The same `Dist[A]` instances that would be used with
a mutable generator are also applicable here.

#### Creation random values with Dist[A]

The `Dist[A]` type class represents a strategy for generating a
distribution of `A` values given a `Generator` instance. `Dist[A]`
makes no guarantee as to how the `A` values are distributed (for
instance, it may always return the same value). Users who are
interested in particular distributions should use the `Uniform[A]`,
`Gaussian[A]`, and `Exponential[A]` traits to generate `Dist[A]`
instances that correspond to their needs.

The `Dist[A]` objects themselves are immutable and are powered by
generators (both mutable and immutable). They can be transformed via
`map`, `flatMap`, and other combinators. Given the appropriate
structure on `A`, `Dist[A]` instances can also be operated on as if
they were value.

#### Distributions

Currently, `spire.random` provides `Uniform[A]`, `Gaussian[A]`, and
`Exponential[A]` type classes which given appropriate parameters can
produce `Dist[A]` instances. Since most types have a (approximately)
infinite number of possible values, bounds and other constraints need
to be put on these types before we can usefully talk about (or
implement) probability distributions in Spire.

 * Given `min` and `max`, a `Uniform[A]` instance can produce a
   uniformly-distributed `Dist[A]` instance.

 * Given `mean` and `stdDev`, a `Gaussian[A]` instance can produce a
   `Dist[A]` whose values are distributed according to the desired
   gaussian distribution.

 * Given `rate`, a `Gaussian[A]` instance can produce a `Dist[A]`
   whose values are distributed according to the desired exponential
   distribution.
